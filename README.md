Glossary of common Machine Learning, Statistics and Data Science terms


#### algorithm
A series of repeatable steps for carrying out a certain type of task with data. As with data structures, people studying computer science learn about different algorithms and their suitability for various tasks. Specific data structures often play a role in how certain algorithms get implemented. 

#### artificial intelligence
Also, AI. The ability to have machines act with apparent intelligence, although varying definitions of “intelligence” lead to a range of meanings for the artificial variety. In AI’s early days in the 1960s, researchers sought general principles of intelligence to implement, often using symbolic logic to automate reasoning. As the cost of computing resources dropped, the focus moved more toward statistical analysis of large amounts of data to drive decision making that gives the appearance of intelligence. See also machine learning, data mining  

#### Bayes' Theorem
Also, Bayes' Rule. An equation for calculating the probability that something is true if something potentially related to it is true. If P(A) means “the probability that A is true” and P(A|B) means “the probability that A is true if B is true,” then Bayes' Theorem tells us that P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A)) / P(B). This is useful for working with false positives—for example, if x% of people have a disease, the test for it is correct y% of the time, and you test positive, Bayes' Theorem helps calculate the odds that you actually have the disease. The theorem also makes it easier to update a probability based on new data, which makes it valuable in the many applications where data continues to accumulate. Named for eighteenth-century English statistician and Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes. See also Bayesian network, prior distribution
